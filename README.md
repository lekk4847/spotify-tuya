# Spotify Tuya
Spotify Tuya is a simple script to change the color of your Tuya lights based on the album art of the song you're listening to on Spotify. It is written in JavaScript and is easy to set up. It's using `tuyapi` package and it's currently set to work with LED type B (data should be structured from 20 to 24).

More coming soon...
